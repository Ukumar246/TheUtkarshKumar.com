                Your ability to command a skill set like iOS development in today's market is so crucial‚Ä¶to get clients, work for youself, close big software deals, start a new tech business and change the course of your personal life
                I Karsh Kumar solemnly swear to make you a master of your craft, stand out, be seen, prove your case to the world.

                <br>
                <br>
                ...and in so doing create your greatest destiny possible.

                <br>
                <br>
                My name is Karsh Kumar. I'm a self taught software developer, who literally stood up till 3am every night in my first startup business, building our iOS app mastering every bit of knowledge out there.

                <br>
                <br>
                The doors really opened for me from there, I got an offer to be a consultant of a big and upcoming startup in Toronto, went on to make over $60 a hour in my first consulting job where I had more time in my week than I could spend indoors!
                I would take 6 courses, all my peers were dead jammed on time and study their ass off, while I would keep a consulting job going and average $3,000 a month - for just working couple of hours a week !

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                I got so good at dealing with clients and making professional quality apps - my clients would not let me delegate any work.
                Furthermore, I was not even out of college when I got hired for $50 a hour to teach developers who held a Master's Degree üò≤.
                <br>
                <br>
                I know what your thinking ..... How?
                <br>
                To be honest, I could not believe it at the time either.
                Neither did my parents when they would periodically call me to ask if I needed my college allowance üòÇ.

                <br>
                <br>
                I would stay up till 3am and take Uber to school instead of walk for 15 min just because time was that scarce.
                <br>
                <br>
                I would literally use the money I learned while being a full time overload college student to live the way I always wanted to.
                <br>
                <br>
                I really ‚Äòdid‚Äô crack the code on how to sell my services‚Ä¶and how to come across as an authority, this helped me get into the doors of the hottest startups, meet successful entreprenurs, work with as a partner on creating some of the hottest apps on the AppStore.
